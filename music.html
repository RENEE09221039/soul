        <p>I remember tears streaming down your face
我記得當時眼淚滑過你臉龐<br>
When I said I'll never let you go
當我說我永遠不讓你離開<br>
When all those shadows almost killed the light
當黑暗陰影幾乎吞噬光明<br>
I remember, you said "Don't leave me alone."
我記得你說"別留下我一人"<br>
But all that's gone and dead and past, tonight
但今晚 一切都離去,死去, 逝去了<br>

Just close your eyes
閉上你的雙眼<br>
The sun is going down
太陽就要落下<br>
You'll be alright
你會沒事的<br>
No one can hurt you now
現在沒有人能傷得了你<br>
Come morning light
晨光會來臨<br>
You and I'll be safe and sound.
你我都將安然無恙<br>
Don't you dare look out your window
別害怕窗外的景象<br>
Darling, everything's on fire
親愛的 一切都在燃燒<br>
The war outside our door keeps raging on
門外的戰爭持續蔓延<br>
Hold on to this lullaby,
繼續這首搖籃曲<br>
Even when the music's gone
即使樂聲已經遠離<br>

Just close your eyes
閉上你的雙眼<br>
The sun is going down
太陽就要落下<br>
You'll be alright
你會沒事的<br>
No one can hurt you now
現在沒有人能傷得了你<br>
The morning light
晨光會來臨<br>
You and I'lll be safe and sound
你我都將安然無恙.<br>

Just close your eyes

        <p>Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
愛著他 就像駕著全新的馬莎拉蒂跑車開到沒有出口的街<br>
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
比風還迅速 罪惡般熱情 卻突然停止<br>
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
愛著他 就像在高處一躍而下後改變心意<br>
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
像深秋的顏色 如此明亮 在所有美景消失前<br>

Losing him was blue, like I've never known
失去他 像是我從未見過的藍<br>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
思念他 像是孤單的深灰色<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
忘記他 像是試著假裝認識一個陌生人<br>
But loving him was red 
愛著他 就是紅色<br>
Loving him was red
愛著他 是紅色的<br>

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
觸摸他 就像夢寐以求的一切就在眼前<br>
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
記住他 就像記起老歌歌詞一樣簡單<br>
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
與他爭吵 就像解開文字謎般 沒有標準答案<br>
Regretting him was like wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong
失去他而感到遺憾 就像希望自己從不曉得 愛可以如此堅定<br>

Losing him was blue, like I've never known
失去他 像是我從未見過的藍<br>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
想著他 像是孤單的深灰色<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
忘記他 就像假裝認識一個你從未見過的人<br>
But loving him was red 
愛著他 是紅色<br>

Oh, red
Burning red
燃燒般的火紅<br>

Remembering him comes in flashbacks, in echoes
回憶像幻燈片 像回音襲來 <br>
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
告訴自己該是時候放手了<br>
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
但我的腦海中滿是他的身影 我怎麼能釋懷<br>

Burning red
燃燒般的火紅<br>

Loving him was red
愛著他是紅色的<br>

Losing him was blue, like I've never known
失去他 像是我從未見過的藍<br>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
想著他 像是孤單的深灰色<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
忘記他 像是試著假裝認識一個你從未見過的人<br>
Cuz loving him was red 
愛著他 就是紅色<br>


Burning red
燃燒般的火紅<br>


that's why he's ladynerdy.blogspot.tw spinning round in my head 
那是他在我腦海不斷盤旋的原因<br>
Comes back to me, burning red
像火焰般反噬我<br>
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
他的愛就像駕著全新的馬莎拉蒂跑車開到沒有出口的街</p></td>
